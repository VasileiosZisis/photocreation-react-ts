        As the owner of this website (the “Site”), Dimitris Domouchtsis/Studio
        Photo Creation (“we” or “us”) understand that your privacy is of

      <h2 className='privacy-h2'>Our Use of Cookies</h2>
      <p>
        A cookie is a file containing an identifier (a string of letters and
        numbers) that is sent by a web server to a web browser and is stored by
        the browser. The identifier is then sent back to the server each time
        the browser requests a page from the server. Cookies may be either
        “persistent” cookies or “session” cookies: a persistent cookie will be
        stored by a web browser and will remain valid until its set expiry date,
        unless deleted by the user before the expiry date; a session cookie, on
        the other hand, will expire at the end of the user session, when the web
        browser is closed. Cookies do not typically contain any information that
        personally identifies a user, but personal information that we store
        about you may be linked to the information stored in and obtained from
        cookies.
